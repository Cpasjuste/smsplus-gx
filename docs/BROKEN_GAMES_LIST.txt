Known issues
=============

-  Fantastic Dizzy (Master System) : PAL Timings

Active Range should be 294 for PAL but it had to be set to 267 to make Dizzy work properly.
Unfortunately this is still not quite correct, we need a proper fix for it.

-  The Adventures of Batman & Robin (Game Gear) Disappearing health bar & score

The health bar & score alternates and disappear. 
The issue also affects Genesis Plus GX.
It looks like it may have to do with sprites going overbound from the looks of it.

- Graphics Board

No support for it given how recent it is. MEKA supports this so i should take a look at it.

- Space Gun
http://www.smspower.org/Development/SpaceGun-SMS

I need to add back Lightgun emulation.
The code is left turned off for now because most games also support the controllers but this game requires the light gun.

There's also an issue with memory mapping. I believe we don't suffer from that bug ?

-  Korean games (Mostly SG-1000 & Master System)
Some of these are interesting and rely on odd behaviours and/or require hardware extensions.
(Extra RAM for the SG-1000 for example)


Problematic games (To be checked & tested)
=================================

-   Alibaba and 40 Thieves / Block Hole 
http://www.smspower.org/Development/AlibabaAnd40Thieves-SMS
Looks like it will need more research.

-  Bank Panic : R register
http://www.smspower.org/Development/BankPanic-SMS

I need to check if that's the case but there's so much we can do as we are already using the latest 
z80 core. (bar a few missing updates)

-  California Games II
http://www.smspower.org/Development/CaliforniaGamesII-SMS
Sonic's Edusoft had a similar issue with it expecting VDP Register 1 to be set to 0xE0, which is what the BIOS sets it to.

-  Dallyeora Pigu Wang
http://www.smspower.org/Development/DallyeoraPiguWang-SMS

Uses R register and Korean mapper. (Filesize is also not a power of 2)
Sounds like a problem.

-  Impossible Mission
http://www.smspower.org/Development/ImpossibleMission-SMS
Uses R register. 

-  James Pond 3 - Operation Starfi5h (Game Gear)
http://www.smspower.org/Development/JamesPond3-GG

-  Rainbow Islands
http://www.smspower.org/Development/RainbowIslands-SMS
Brazil release fixed this, perhaps we could patch the game on the fly ?
But that would be outside the scope of an emulator.

-  PGA Tour Golf

-  Zool : Ninja of the Nth Dimension
