Implementations :
https://github.com/OpenEmu/CrabEmu-Core/blob/master/consoles/sms/mapper-93c46.c

World Series Baseball '95 and World Series Baseball will hang up without at least a stub in place.

-  Fix PAL specific code

Active Range should be 294 for PAL but it had to be set to 267 to make Fantastic Dizzy work properly.
Unfortunately this is still not quite correct, we need a proper fix for it.

- LCD Persistence issues

Some games take advantage of the Game Gear's poor LCD screen.
If this behaviour is not replicated then it results in some heavy flickering.

Here's a list of affected games :

-  The Adventures of Batman & Robin (Disappearing HUD)
-  Super Monaco GP 2 (Titlescreen)
-  Space Harrier
-  Ninja Gaiden (affects 3rd & 2nd act)
-  Halley Wars
-  MLBPA Baseball
-  Power Drive (unreleased prototype)
-  James Pond 3 (Overworld level text)

MAME has an implementation of LCD persistence here (first appeared in MESS 0.135) :

-  Graphics Board

No support for it given how recent it is. MEKA supports this so i should take a look at it.

-  Space Gun

http://www.smspower.org/Development/SpaceGun-SMS

I need to add back Lightgun emulation.
The code is left turned off for now because most games also support the controllers but this game requires the light gun.

There's also an issue with memory mapping. I believe we don't suffer from that bug ?

-  Sports Pad

Not currently implemented.
In addition to that, a bug has been discovered where the game would sometimes read the input from player 1 for player 2.
Do we really want to implement this bug though ???

Problematic games (To be checked & tested)
=================================

-  Dallyeora Pigu Wang

http://www.smspower.org/Development/DallyeoraPiguWang-SMS

Uses R register and Korean mapper. (Filesize is also not a power of 2)
Sounds like a problem.

-  Rainbow Islands

http://www.smspower.org/Development/RainbowIslands-SMS
Brazil release fixed this, perhaps we could patch the game on the fly ?
But that would be outside the scope of an emulator.

-  PGA Tour Golf

-  Zool : Ninja of the Nth Dimension
