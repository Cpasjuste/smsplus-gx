-  The GPLv2 EightyOne's Z80 CPU Core is very inaccurate. While it's much improved compared to last version,
it's still much inferior to the original z80.c core. For example, Fantastic Dizzy is completely bugged with it.
According to Flubba's VDP test, it's also not perfectly in sync with the display. 
It could be an issue with timing too rather than accuracy... Unfortunely, that's way over my head :c

I also tried to add support for CrabEmu's own z80 core but i couldn't manage to make it work.
Perhaps i could try it again with CZ80 instead ?
