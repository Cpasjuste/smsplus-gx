Charles Mcdonald
================

Released his SMS emulator since 0.9 under the GPLv2+.
It stayed like so until after versopn 1.5 (source code to version 1.5 got lost unfortunately but we still have SmSPlus-GX thankfully).
After version 1.5, he decided for unknown reasons to switch it to a non-commercial license, turning it proprietary again.
Another newer upstream fork also uses this license. Therefore, i need to be very careful about this and make sure we're not using 
any code from that version to the full extent of the jam. (i mean law)

He also contributed modifications to sn76489.c, i contacted him and he told me it fell under the same license as Maxim's.

ekeeke
======
He worked on SMSPlus-GX, with several improvements such as improved accuracy, fixing bugs with most games etc...
It was originally designed for the Gamecube/Wii.

This fork also has code for Colecovision. Although it does claim to support Colecovision games,
in my testings, it doesn't, even if i force it to Colecovision mode. It wouldn't boot any games for me.

The overscan code got removed because it was not useful and little to no SMS make use of it.

Alekmaul
=========
He came up with the bitmap_scale function. That function is solely used for the menu and unscaled.

Harteex
========
Came up with the TGA font loading code and he converted the fonts to a c array with bin2h.

dmitrysmagin
=============
- Menu code based on his fork sms_sdl-rzx50 available here :
https://github.com/dmitrysmagin/sms_sdl-rzx50

The fonts were also taken from that repository.

exmortis@yandex.ru, joyrider
============================
They are mostly responsible for making the initial port of Dingux-SMS for the Dingoo.
I don't think there's much of their code left, if any.

PocketSprite
============
Patches to switch SMS Plus to EightyOne's Z80 CPU core. (based itself on FUSE)
https://github.com/PocketSprite/8bkc-gamegear/commit/cd3510d12feb8f922c0505a2a47e4a58b5fef9f0

Contrarely to what they say, it is based on SMS Plus 0.9, not SMS Plus 1.3 with the TMS support and all.
The fact that it uses sms_frame (rather than system_frame from SMS Plus 1.2+) further confirms this.
This patch switches to a GPLv2 Z80 Core so it can be used for commercial use, which is what they did.
Anyway, those patches wouldn't work as is on SMS Plus 1.2 but they did tell me how i should switch to another Z80's core.
And for that, i am very grateful.

Most of my issues with it were related to irq & cpureadmap (which turns out, required minor changes for it to work)

EightyOne ZX81
==============
https://github.com/PocketSprite/8bkc-gamegear/commit/cd3510d12feb8f922c0505a2a47e4a58b5fef9f0
(Based on that)
https://github.com/libretro/81-libretro/tree/master/81/z80

See PocketSprite's patches. We're using this z80 cpu core instead of z80.c.
Btw, i did contact Jurgeen about z80.c and he refused to re-license the old versions due to potential legal issues.
So for a full GPLv2 release, this was the first step towards it.
As a result, z80.c and all related code got removed.

Anyway, i haven't noticed any nasty regressions as far emulation is concerned so yay for me.

CrabEmu
========
https://github.com/OpenEmu/CrabEmu-Core/blob/master/sound/sn76489.c
https://github.com/OpenEmu/CrabEmu-Core/blob/master/sound/ym2413.c

The ym2413 & sn76489 sound emulators from CrabEmu were used as the stock ones provided with SMS_Plus did not clarify their licenses.
ym2413.c is based on MAME's GPLv2 code, with some modifications that switches it to C as well as provide some functions to use it more easily.
The changes are also released under the GPLv2.

sn76489.c by CrabEmu does not seem to be based upon any code other than Maxim's documentation and some snippets of code.
It shares little to no similarity with Maxim's code and it is also released under the GPLv2.

Gameblabla, me
==============

Switced most variables to c99 data types. (Fixed rendering issues on 64-bits and somewhat broken PSG sound for Maxim's PSG core)
Improving PocketSprite's EightyOne patches for making sure it works with the newer SMS Plus version. (not as straightfoward as it might seem)
Disabled collision check for 9th sprite. Doing so passes Flubba's test.
Put everything together and making sure it works :' )

Maxim
=====
He's the author of sn76489.c (not crabemu's one), a sn76489 emulator.
Contacted by email, he said that it was released along with in_vgm as a whole under this license :
You are allowed to do what you like with it just so long as:
1. You let me know if you distribute it (any included files or anything derived from them), and
2. You don't pass it off as your own.

Clause 1 is problematic and potentially makes it non-free. (He did say that he plans to relicense it)
As a failsafe, CrabEmu's PSG emulation is also provided.
