SMS_SDL Plus
==================

This is a somewhat improved port of SMS_SDL with fixes for 64-bits, switching to EightyOne's Z80 core (changes from PocketSprite's SMS Plus fork) 
and a somewhat tweaked GUI from SMS_SDL's Dingux. (That version is broken since GCC 7.x btw)

To be fixed :

- Upgrade to SMS Plus 1.3 or 1.8 with TMS emulation.
- Then switch that to our current z80 core.
